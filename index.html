            Hey there, Iâ€™m Cleo Reyes.
        </h1>
        <h2>
            I am currently an undergraduate
        </h2>
        <p>
            at the University of Washington studying Informatics at the Information School on a Software Development Engineering track.         
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about creating software that is optimal, accessible, and interactive for users of all backgrounds. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I believe that technology harnesses the potential to transform the lives of many and that it is our responsibility to create solutions that work for everybody!

        <p>
            Outside of academics and career, I am always listening to music, practicing or learning new dance choreographies, spending time with friends or family, snapping some pictures, or exploring Seattle!
